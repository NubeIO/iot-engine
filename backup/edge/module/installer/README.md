# Edge Installer

It is `service installer` module that lives on [`BIOS`](../../bios/README.md) in `IoT Edge device`.

- `Service` is `NubeIO service` application or `3rd service` application. Each service should be design for specific tasks, e.g: read/write `GPIO` point, connect `BACNet/Modbus/Haystack`, etc.

## Architecture design
